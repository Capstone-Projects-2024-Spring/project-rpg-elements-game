# Version Control
GitHub will be used as the version control system.

The main branch will be protected. Commits can't be made directly to the main branch. 

Any pull requests made will require other developers to review the code and resolve merge conflicts before the changes are merged to the main branch.

Each developer will have their own branch. Additional branches can be created if needed.
