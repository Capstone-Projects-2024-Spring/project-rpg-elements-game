Figure 1 shows the proposed design for our 2D Platformer game, which will run on all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, & Linux). The game can be downloaded, installed, and booted from your local PC as a desktop application. The front-end character design of the game will be created internally and animated using the Unity Engine. Custom scripting in C# will be used for player movements, animations, game physics, and the procedural generation of the map. Multiplayer will be implemented using the Photon Unity Networking solution and will provide real-time cloud-hosted matchmaking and in-game chat. User authentication, chat messages, achievements, and friends' lists will be stored and implemented using Firebase real-time Database/Authentication tools.
