After joining a lobby, players can pick from a variety of different characters to play as, with each character having a distinct set of attacks that comprise their move set. Each character also has different attributes (for example, one character can have a high attack power but low defense, while a different character can have low attack power and high defense).

Meanwhile, RPGs like Pok\xe9mon or Xenoblade Chronicles allow the player to customize their characters with different attacks the more they level up. While the pace of RPGs is much slower than the pace of 2D platformers, there are games like Super Paper Mario that successfully integrate the mechanics of RPGs in 2D Platformers in a seamless fashion. This game aims to be a unique blend of these two wildly different genres of games that are very popular themselves but are seldom combined."})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.ah)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},3905:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{ah:()=>c});var a=r(67294);function n(e,t,r){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:r,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=r,e}function i(e,t){var r=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(a=a.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),r.push.apply(r,a)}return r}function s(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var r=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?i(Object(r),!0).forEach((function(t){n(e,t,r[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(r)):i(Object(r)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(r,t))}))}return e}function o(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var r,a,n=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var r,a,n={},i=Object.keys(e);for(a=0;a<i.length;a++)r=i[a],t.indexOf(r)>=0||(n[r]=e[r]);return n}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(a=0;a<i.length;a++)r=i[a],t.indexOf(r)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,r)&&(n[r]=e[r])}return n}var l=a.createContext({}),c=function(e){var t=a.useContext(l),r=t;return e&&(r="function"==typeof e?e(t):s(s({},t),e)),r},h={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return a.createElement(a.Fragment,{},t)}},m=a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var r=e.components,n=e.mdxType,i=e.originalType,l=e.parentName,m=o(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),p=c(r),d=n,u=p["".concat(l,".").concat(d)]||p[d]||h[d]||i;return r?a.createElement(u,s(s({ref:t},m),{},{components:r})):a.createElement(u,s({ref:t},m))}));m.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
