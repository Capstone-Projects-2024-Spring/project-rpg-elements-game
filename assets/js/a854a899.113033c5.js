Meanwhile, RPGs like Pok\xe9mon or Xenoblade Chronicles allow the player to customize their characters with different attacks the more they level up. While the pace of RPGs is much slower than the pace of 2D platformers, there are games like Super Paper Mario that successfully integrate the mechanics of RPGs in 2D Platformers in a seamless fashion.
